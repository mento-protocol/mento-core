## How To Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to the development of Mento. Contributions can be made to this repo via issues and pull requests. However, before contributing, you should have a good understanding of how Mento is intended to work and the different components that make up the core protocol. You can learn more about Mento by taking some time to read the following:

* [Protocol Documentation](https://docs.mento.org/mento-protocol/core/overview)
* [Stability Whitepaper](https://celo.org/papers/stability)

### Reporting Bugs

Before making a bug report, check the list of open issues, as you may find that a report already exists for the same bug. You can report a bug by creating an issue and selecting the bug report template. When filling out the template, please include as much detail as possible.

### Suggesting Features

You can contribute to the development of Mento by suggesting new features to be built or enhancements to existing functionality. Before proposing a feature, check that an issue does not already exist for the feature or enhancement. To suggest a feature or enhancement, create a new issue and select the feature request template. Once your issue has been created, it's best to start a discussion in the Mento [discord server](http://chat.mento.org) referencing the issue.

### Code Contributions

Code contributions can be made by creating a pull request that addresses an open issue labelled with **good first issue** or **help wanted**. PR's that address styling issues or add unit/integration tests are always welcome. For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes, it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first.
